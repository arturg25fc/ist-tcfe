\par In this laboratory assignment, the goal of analysing the circuit has been achieved. Theoretically, both node and mesh analyses have been performed, and the results were obtained using the Octave maths tool. Besides that, a circuit simulation, using the Ngspice tool, was also executed. The simulation results matched the theoretical results almost precisely, as explained in Section~\ref{sec:simulation}. The excellent match relies on the fact that this is a quite straightforward circuit, containing only linear and simple components. So, eventhough the theoretical and simulation models could differ - when using more complex components- this is not the case in this work.

\par In conclusion, we confirmed that this was a very important circuit to study, since it allowed us to expand our understanding of the basics of electronic circuits. It was also pretty curious for us to apply some physics concepts we have learned in other disciplines when studying this circuit and being able to testify that they work in practise.
