\par In this laboratory assignment, the goal of analysing the circuit has been achieved. Theoretically, static analysis has been performed along with the study of time and frequency responses (studying both magnitude and phase dependence of frequency). The results were obtained using the Octave maths tool. Besides that, a circuit simulation, using the Ngspice tool, was also executed. The simulation results allowed us to verify our theoretical conclusions, since they matched almost precisely, as explained in Section~\ref{sec:simulation}.

\par In conclusion, we consider that this was a very important circuit to study, since it involves multiple essential components, such as the capacitor. It was also quite interesting to apply what we have learned in class and confirm it by observing the obtained results.
