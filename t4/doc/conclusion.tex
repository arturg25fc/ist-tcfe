\par Overall, the obtained merit was $1974.686$ and the cost was $727.4 MU$. However, there are several noticeable differencies in the obtained values, which is not that satisfactory, but it is the result of the employement of an imprecise theoretical analysis method. 
\par In conclusion, we found this a very important circuit to develop and analyse, since it's practical applications are very useful. Besides that, it was also quite interesting to learn the way transistors work, as they are one of the most important components nowadays, being widely used in eletronics.
